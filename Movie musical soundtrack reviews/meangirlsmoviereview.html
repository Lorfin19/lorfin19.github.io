        <p>
            Certain songs contain suggestive lines. Some language as well; a**h***, b****, a use of sh**, and some talk of underage drinking and drug use. Also a number about dressing "Sexy" on Halloween. One song saying to "Raise your right finger...". Bonus track (#13) contains much profanity, as well as adult content.

            After a life in Kenya, 16-year-old Cady Heron moves back to the US and starts school at North Shore High. After befriending two outsiders, who warn her of the trio of mean girls called the Plastics, she soon sees the appeal of being popular and becomes plastic herself.

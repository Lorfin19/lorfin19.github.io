        <p>
            After a teen (Connor Murphy) at the school commits suicide, his family believes that his fellow high schooler Evan Hansen was friends with him, so he forges several letters to prove this is true, and Connor's family takes Evan in as if he was their own son. After the false nature of the letters is revealed, the family no longer wants anything to do with Evan, but he survives hardship and walks away from this challenge stronger.

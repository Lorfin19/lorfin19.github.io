            Several scenes have cursing, some cussing as well. A large part of the story revolves around a murder trial. One song about the "bend and snap" maneuver, and one about whether or not a suspect is "gay or European." A character fakes a sexual act during the song "So Much Better."

            Elle Woods expects her boyfriend to propose to her, but instead he breaks up with her to go to Harvard Law School. She then follows him there in an attempt to get him back, while proving to everyone that she is more than just the "dumb blonde" she seems to be.

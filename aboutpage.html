        Being a huge theater kid myself, I decided it would be fun to start a YouTube channel where I could post and talk about all my nerdy theater stuff, and since I know there are many others like me, I figured there would be a few people interested in such a channel.
  </p>
    I started Broadway Review because theater isn't always appropriate for everyone, and I believe that people should have the knowledge to be able to make informed desicions about what they or their children should watch and listen to.
  <p>
    My cousin and I created a joint YouTube channel because, throughout our lives, we've come up with some pretty neat stuff that is going to be super fun to chat and start podcasts about.

  As always, enjoy the chaotic theater content.

                Welcome to the official website of Theraworks. Greetings from your hosts, Padow and Lorfin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We, your hosts, have taken all the weird and wonderful stuff we have come up with and put it all into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thehoneybumbles" target=_blank><b>channel</b></a> for your entertainment, and here is our official website. If you are interested in: a multitude of smoothies, stuffed animal theme parks, living room forts, Emperorâ€™s New Groove dances, a whole lot of Minecraft playing, stories (including much character lore, drama, and alternate realities/personalities), the full story of OceanCraft (our beloved Minecraft SMP), the origin of Theraworks, various real-world games (involving top-secret organizations), a sacred pit of death (for some reason), some theater stuff, TF2 adventures, a quote book that has recently become a DRG (Documented Reality Game) and subsequently this organization, and a sexy tree (don't ask...), then join the Theraworks community.
